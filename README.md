## Overview

WinFsp is a platform that provides development and runtime support for custom file systems on Windows computers. Typically any information or storage may be organized and presented as a file system via WinFsp, with the benefit being that the information can be accessed via the standard Windows file APIs by any Windows application.

The core WinFsp consists of a kernel mode file system driver (FSD) and a user mode DLL. The FSD interfaces with the Windows kernel and handles all interactions necessary to present itself as a file system driver. The DLL interfaces with the FSD and presents an API that can be used to handle file system functions. For example, when an application attempts to open a file, the file system receives an `Open` call with the necessary information.

Using WinFsp to build a file system has many benefits:

**Easy development**: Developing kernel mode file systems for Windows is a notoriously difficult task. WinFsp makes file system development relatively painless. This [Tutorial](doc/WinFsp-Tutorial.asciidoc) explains how to build a file system.

**Stability**: Stable software without any known kernel mode crashes, resource leaks or similar problems. WinFsp owes this stability to its [Design](doc/WinFsp-Design.asciidoc) and its rigorous [Testing Regime](doc/WinFsp-Testing.asciidoc).

**Correctness**: Strives for file system correctness and compatibility with NTFS. For details see the [Compatibility](doc/NTFS-Compatibility.asciidoc) document.

**Performance**: Has excellent performance that rivals or exceeds that of NTFS in many file system scenarios. Read more about its [Performance](doc/WinFsp-Performance-Testing.asciidoc).

</p>

**Wide support**: Supports Windows 7 to Windows 11 and the x86, x64 and ARM64 architectures.

**Flexible API**: Includes Native, FUSE2, FUSE3 and .NET APIs.

**Shell integration**: Provides facilities to integrate user mode file systems with the Windows shell. See the [Service Architecture](doc/WinFsp-Service-Architecture.asciidoc) document.

**Self-contained**: Self-contained software without external dependencies.

**Widely used**: Used in many open-source and commercial applications with millions of installations (estimated: the WinFsp project does not track its users).

**Flexible licensing**: Available under the [GPLv3](License.txt) license with a special exception for Free/Libre and Open Source Software. A commercial license is also available. Please contact Bill Zissimopoulos \<billziss at navimatics.com> for more details.

## Installation

Download and run the [WinFsp installer](https://github.com/winfsp/winfsp/releases/latest). In the installer select the option to install the "Developer" files. These include the MEMFS sample file system, but also header and library files that let you develop your own user-mode file system.

### Launch a file system for testing

You can test WinFsp by launching MEMFS from the command line:

```
billziss@xps ⟩ ~ ⟩ net use X: \\memfs64\test
The command completed successfully.

billziss@xps ⟩ ~ ⟩ X:
billziss@xps ⟩ X:\ ⟩ echo "hello world" > hello.txt
billziss@xps ⟩ X:\ ⟩ dir


    Directory: X:\


Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a----         6/12/2022   5:15 PM             28 hello.txt


billziss@xps ⟩ X:\ ⟩ type hello.txt
hello world
billziss@xps ⟩ X:\ ⟩ cd ~
billziss@xps ⟩ ~ ⟩ net use X: /delete
X: was deleted successfully.
```

MEMFS (and all file systems that use the WinFsp Launcher as documented in the [Service Architecture](doc/WinFsp-Service-Architecture.asciidoc) document) can also be launched from Explorer using the "Map Network Drive" functionality.
