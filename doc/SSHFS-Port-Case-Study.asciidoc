= SSHFS Port Case Study

This document is a case study in porting SSHFS to Windows and WinFsp. At the time that the document was started WinFsp had a native API, but no FUSE compatible API. The main purpose of the case study was to develop a FUSE compatible API for WinFsp.

== Step 1: Gather Information about SSHFS

The SSHFS project is one of the early FUSE projects. The project was originally written by Miklos Szeredi who is also the author of FUSE. SSHFS provides a file system interface on top of SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol).

The project's website is at https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs. A quick perusal of the source code shows that this is a POSIX program, the file `configure.ac` further shows that it depends on GLib and FUSE.

Luckily Cygwin on Windows provides a POSIX interface and it also includes GLib and pkg-config. We are missing FUSE of course. Let's try it anyway:

----
billziss@windows:~/Projects/ext$ git clone https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs.git
Cloning into 'sshfs'...
[snip]
billziss@windows:~/Projects/ext$ cd sshfs/
billziss@windows:~/Projects/ext/sshfs [master]$ autoreconf -i
[snip]
billziss@windows:~/Projects/ext/sshfs [master]$ ./configure
[snip]
configure: error: Package requirements (fuse >= 2.3 glib-2.0 gthread-2.0) were not met:

No package 'fuse' found
----

As expected we get an error because there is no package named FUSE. So let's create one.

== Step 2: Create a FUSE Compatible Package

After a few days of development there exists now an initial FUSE implementation within WinFsp. Most of the FUSE API's from the header files `fuse.h`, `fuse_common.h` and `fuse_opt.h` have been implemented. However none of the `fuse_operations` currently work as the necessary work to translate WinFsp requests to FUSE requests has not happened yet.

=== Challenges

- The FUSE API is old and somewhat hairy. There are multiple versions of it and choosing the right one was not easy. In the end version 2.8 of the API was chosen for implementation.

- The FUSE API uses a number of OS specific types (notably `struct stat`). Sometimes these types have multiple definitions even within the same OS (e.g. `struct stat` and `struct stat64`). For this reason it was decided to define our own `fuse_*` types (e.g. `struct fuse_stat`) instead of relying on the ones that come with MSVC. Care was taken to ensure that these types remain compatible with Cygwin as it is one of our primary target environments.

- The WinFsp DLL does *not* use the MSVCRT and uses its own memory allocator (`HeapAlloc`, `HeapFree`). Even if it used the MSVCRT `malloc`, it does not have access to the Cygwin `malloc`. The FUSE API has a few cases where users are expected to use `free` to deallocate memory (e.g. `fuse_opt_add_opt`). But which `free` is that for a Cygwin program? The Cygwin `free`, the MSVCRT `free` or our own `MemFree`?
+
To solve this problem we use the following pattern: every FUSE API is implemented as a `static inline` function that calls a WinFsp-FUSE API and passes it an extra argument that describes the environment:
+
----
static inline int fuse_opt_add_opt(char **opts, const char *opt)
{
    return fsp_fuse_opt_add_opt(fsp_fuse_env(), opts, opt);
}
----
+
The `fsp_fuse_env` function is another `static inline` function that simply "captures" the current environment (things like the environment's `malloc` and `free`).
+
----
...
#elif defined(__CYGWIN__)
...
#define FSP_FUSE_ENV_INIT               \
    {                                   \
        'C',                            \
        malloc, free,                   \
        fsp_fuse_daemonize,             \
        fsp_fuse_set_signal_handlers,   \
        fsp_fuse_remove_signal_handlers,\
    }
...
#else
...

static inline struct fsp_fuse_env *fsp_fuse_env(void)
{
    static struct fsp_fuse_env env = FSP_FUSE_ENV_INIT;
    return &env;
}
----

- The implementation of `fuse_opt` proved an unexpected challenge. The function `fuse_opt_parse` is very flexible, but it also has a lot of quirks. It took a lot of trial and error to arrive at a clean reimplementation.

=== Things that worked rather nicely

- The pattern `fuse_new` / `fuse_loop` / `fuse_destroy` fits nicely to the WinFsp service model: `FspServiceCreate` / `FspServiceLoop` / `FspServiceDelete`. This means that every (high-level)  FUSE file system can rather easily be converted into a Windows service if desired.

=== Integrating with Cygwin

It remains to show how to use the WinFsp-FUSE implementation from Cygwin and SSHFS. SSHFS uses `pkg-config` for its build configuration. `Pkg-config` requires a `fuse.pc` file:

----
arch=x64
prefix=${pcfiledir}/..
incdir=${prefix}/inc/fuse
implib=${prefix}/bin/winfsp-${arch}.dll

Name: fuse
Description: WinFsp FUSE compatible API
Version: 2.8
URL: http://www.secfs.net/winfsp/
Libs: "${implib}"
Cflags: -I"${incdir}"
----

The WinFsp installer has been modified to place this file within its installation directory. It remains to point `pkg-config` to the appropriate location (using `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`) and the SSHFS configuration process can now find the FUSE package.

=== SSHFS-Win

The sshfs-win open-source project (work in progress) can be found here: https://bitbucket.org/billziss/sshfs-win

== Step 3: Mapping Windows to POSIX

It would seem that we are now ready to start implementing the `fuse_operations`. However there is another matter that we need to attend to first and that is mapping the Windows file system view of the world to the POSIX one and vice-versa.

=== Mapping Paths

The Windows and POSIX file systems both use paths to address files. The path conventions are different, so we need a technique to convert between the two. This goes beyond a simple translation of the backslash character (`\`) to slash (`/`), because several characters are reserved and cannot be used in a Windows file path, but are legal when used in a POSIX path.

The reserved Windows characters are:

----
<   >   :   "   /   \   |   ?   *
any character between 0 and 31
----

POSIX only has two reserved characters: slash (`/`) and `NUL`.

So how do we map between the two? Luckily this problem has been solved before by "Services for Macintosh" (SFM), "Services for UNIX" (SFU) and Cygwin. The solution involves the use of the Unicode "private use area". When mapping a POSIX path to Windows, if we encounter any of the Windows reserved characters we simply map it to the Unicode range U+F000 - U+F0FF. The reverse mapping from Windows to POSIX is obvious.

=== Mapping Security

Mapping Windows security to POSIX (and vice-versa) is a much more interesting (and difficult) problem. We have the following requirements:

- We need a method to map a Windows SID (Security Identifier) to a POSIX uid/gid.
- We need a method to map a Windows ACL (Access Control List) to a POSIX permission set.
- We want any mapping method we come up with to be bijective (to the extent that it is possible).

Luckily "Services for UNIX" (and Cygwin) come to the rescue again. The following Cygwin document describes in great detail a method to map a Windows SID to a POSIX uid/gid that is compatible with SFU: https://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/ntsec.html. A different document from SFU describes how to map a Windows ACL to POSIX permissions: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb463216.aspx.

The mappings provided are not perfect, but they come pretty close. They are also proven as they have been used in SFU and Cygwin for years.

=== WinFsp Implementation

A WinFsp implementation of the above mappings can be found in the file `src/dll/posix.c`.

== Step 4: Implementing FUSE Core

We are now finally ready to implement the `fuse_operations`. This actually proves to be a straightforward mapping of the WinFSP `FSP_FILE_SYSTEM_INTERACE` to `fuse_operations`:

GetVolumeInfo:: Mapped to `statfs`. Volume labels are not supported by FUSE (see below).

SetVolumeLabel:: No equivalent on FUSE, so simply return `STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER`. One thought is to map this call into a `setxattr("sys.VolumeLabel")` (or similar) call on the root directory (`/`).

GetSecurityByName:: Mapped to `fgetattr`/`getattr`. The returned `stat` information is translated into a Windows security descriptor using `FspPosixMapPermissionsToSecurityDescriptor`.

Create:: This is used to create a new file or directory. If a file is created this is mapped to `create` or `mknod`;`open`. If a directory is created this is mapped to `mkdir`;`opendir` calls (the reason is that on Windows a directory remains open after being created). In some circumstances a `chown` may be issued as well. After the file or directory has been created a `fgetattr`/`getattr` is issued to get `stat` information to return to the FSD.

Open:: This is used to open a new file or directory. First a `fgetattr`/`getattr` is issued. If the file is not a directory it is followed by `open`. If the file is a directory it is followed by `opendir`.

Overwrite:: This is used to overwrite a file when one of the `FILE_OVERWRITE`, `FILE_SUPERSEDE` or `FILE_OVERWRITE_IF` flags has been set. Mapped to `ftruncate`/`truncate`.

Cleanup:: Mapped to `unlink` when deleting a file and `rmdir` when deleting a directory.

Close:: Mapped to `flush`;`release` when closing a file and `releasedir` when closing a directory.

Read:: Mapped to `read`.

Write:: Mapped to `fgetattr`/`getattr` and `write`.

Flush:: Mapped to `fsync` or `fsyncdir`.

GetFileInfo:: Mapped to `fgetattr`/`getattr`.

SetBasicInfo:: Mapped to `utimens`/`utime`.

SetAllocationSize:: Mapped to `fgetattr`/`getattr` followed by `ftruncate`/`truncate`. Note that this call and `SetFileSize` may be consolidated soon in the WinFsp API.

SetFileSize:: Mapped to `fgetattr`/`getattr` followed by `ftruncate`/`truncate`. Note that this call and `SetAllocationSize` may be consolidated soon in the WinFsp API.

CanDelete:: For directories only: mapped to a `getdir`/`readdir` call to determine if they are empty and can therefore be deleted.

Rename:: Mapped to `fgetattr`/`getattr` on the destination file name and `rename`.

GetSecurity:: Mapped to `fgetattr`/`getattr`. The returned `stat` information is translated into a Windows security descriptor using `FspPosixMapPermissionsToSecurityDescriptor`.

SetSecurity:: Mapped to `fgetattr`/`getattr` followed by `chmod` and/or `chown`.

ReadDirectory:: Mapped to `getdir`/`readdir`. Note that because of how the Windows directory enumeration API's work there is a further `fgetattr`/`getattr` per file returned!

=== Some Additional Challenges

Let us now discuss a couple of final challenges in getting a proper FUSE port working under Cygwin: the implementation of `fuse_set_signal_handlers`/`fuse_remove_signal_handlers` and `fuse_daemonize`.

Let us start with `fuse_set_signal_handlers`/`fuse_remove_signal_handlers`. Cygwin supports POSIX signals and we can simply set up signal handlers similar to what libfuse does. However this simple approach does not work within WinFsp, because it uses native API's that Cygwin cannot interrupt with its signal mechanism. For example, the `fuse_loop` FUSE call eventually results in a `WaitForSingleObject` API call that Cygwin cannot interrupt. Even trying with an alertable `WaitForSingleObjectEx` did not work as unfortunately Cygwin does not issue a `QueueUserAPC` when issuing a signal. So we need an alternative mechanism to support signals.

The alternative is to use `sigwait` in a separate thread. `Fsp_fuse_signal_handler` is a WinFsp API that knows how to interrupt that `WaitForSingleObject` (actually it just signals the waited event).

----
static inline void *fsp_fuse_signal_thread(void *psigmask)
{
    int sig;

    if (0 == sigwait(psigmask, &sig))
        fsp_fuse_signal_handler(sig);

    return 0;
}
----

Let us now move to `fuse_daemonize`. This FUSE call allows a FUSE file system to become a (UNIX) daemon. This is achieved by using the POSIX fork call, which unfortunately has many limitations in Cygwin. One such limitation (and the one that bit us in WinFsp) is that it does not know how to clone Windows heaps (`HeapAlloc`/`HeapFree`).

Recall that WinFsp uses its own memory allocator (just a thin wrapper around `HeapAlloc`/`HeapFree`). This means that any allocations made prior to the fork() call are doomed after a fork(); with good luck the pointers will point to invalid memory and one will get an Access Violation; with bad luck the pointers will point to valid memory that contains bad data and the program may stumble for a while, just enough to hide the actual cause of the problem.

Luckily there is a rather straightforward work-around: "do not allocate any non-Cygwin resources prior to fork". This is actually possible within WinFsp, because we are already capturing the Cygwin environment and its `malloc`/`free` (see `fsp_fuse_env` in "Step 2"). It is also possible, because the typical FUSE program structure looks like this:

----
fuse_new
fuse_daemonize          // do not allocate any non-Cygwin resources prior to this
fuse_loop/fuse_loop_mt  // safe to allocate non-Cygwin resources
fuse_destroy
----

With this change `fuse_daemonize` works and allows me to declare the Cygwin portion of the SSHFS port complete!

== Step 5: POSIX special files

Although WinFsp now has a working FUSE implementation there remains an important problem: how to handle POSIX special files such as named pipes (FIFO), devices (CHR, BLK), sockets (SOCK) or symbolic links (LNK).

While Windows has support for symbolic links (LNK) there is no direct support for other POSIX special files. The question then is how to represent such files when they are accessed by Windows. This is especially important to systems like Cygwin that understand POSIX special files and can even create them.

Cygwin normally emulates symbolic links and special files using special shortcut (.lnk) files. However many FUSE file systems support POSIX special files; it is desirable then that applications, like Cygwin, that understand them should be able to create and access them without resorting to hacks like using .lnk files.

The problem was originally mentioned by Herbert Stocker on the Cygwin mailing list:

[quote]
____
The mkfifo system call will have Cygwin create a .lnk file and
WinFsp will forward it as such to the file system process. The
system calls readdir or open will then have the file system
process tell WinFsp that there is a .lnk file and Cygwin will
translate this back to a fifo, so in this sense it does work.

But the file system will see a file (with name *.lnk) where it
should see a pipe (mknod call with \'mode' set to S_IFIFO).
IMHO one could say this is a break of the FUSE API.

Practically it will break:

- File systems that special-treat pipe files (or .lnk files).

- If one uses sshfs to connect to a Linux based server and
issues the command mkfifo foo from Cygwin, the server will
end up with a .lnk file instead of a pipe special file.

- Imagine something like mysqlfs, which stores the stuff in a
database. When you run SQL statements to analyze the data
in the file system, you won't see the pipes as such. Or if
you open the file system from Linux you'll see the .lnk
files.
____

Herbert is of course right. A .lnk file is not a FIFO to any application other than Cygwin. We need a better mechanism for representing special files. One such mechanism is reparse points.

Reparse points can be viewed as a form of special metadata that can be attached to a file or directory. The interesting thing about reparse points is that they can have special meaning to a file system driver (NTFS/WinFsp), a filter driver (e.g. a hierarchical storage system) or even an application (Cygwin).

Symbolic links are already implemented as reparse points on Windows. We could perhaps define a new reparse point type for representing POSIX special files. Turns out that this is unnecessary, because Microsoft has already defined a reparse point type for special files on NFS: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn617178.aspx

It is a relatively straightforward task then to map reparse point operations into their FUSE equivalents:

GetReparsePoint:: Mapped to `getattr`/`fgetattr` and possibly `readlink` (in the case of a symbolic link). The returned `stat.st_mode` information is transformed to the appropriate reparse point information.

SetReparsePoint:: Mapped to `symlink` or `mknod` depending on whether a symbolic link or other special file is created.
